# Default of Credit Card-
Project on Credit Card Default Prediction by Machine Learning Classification Algorithm

**“Fraud detection is a set of activities that are taken to prevent money or property from being obtained through false pretenses.”**

Fraud can be committed in different ways and in many industries. The majority of detection methods combine a variety of fraud detection datasets to form a connected overview of both valid and non-valid payment data to make a decision. This decision must consider IP address, geolocation, device identification, “BIN” data, global latitude/longitude, historic transaction patterns, and the actual transaction information. In practice, this means that merchants and issuers deploy analytically based responses that use internal and external data to apply a set of business rules or analytical algorithms to detect fraud.

Credit Card Fraud Detection with Machine Learning is a process of data investigation by a Data Science team and the development of a model that will provide the best results in revealing and preventing fraudulent transactions. This is achieved through bringing together all meaningful features of card users’ transactions, such as Date, User Zone, Product Category, Amount, Provider, Client’s Behavioral Patterns, etc. The information is then run through a subtly trained model that finds patterns and rules so that it can classify whether a transaction is fraudulent or is legitimate. All big banks like Chase use fraud monitoring and detection systems.

***The challenge is to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that the customers of credit card companies are not charged for items that they did not purchase.***

**Main challenges involved in credit card fraud detection are:**

* Enormous Data is processed every day and the model build must be fast enough to respond to the scam in time.
* Imbalanced Data i.e most of the transactions (99.8%) are not fraudulent which makes it really hard for detecting the fraudulent ones
* Data availability as the data is mostly private.
* Misclassified Data can be another major issue, as not every fraudulent transaction is caught and reported.
* Adaptive techniques used against the model by the scammers.
